# did:webvh Implementations

Implementations of `did:webvh` software for DID Controller registrars, resolvers, controllers and/or servers can be found here. See each implementation's repository for details on features and capabilities. Please let us know (or submit a PR) if you have an implementation that is not listed here, or if you want to update how your implementation is described.

The [`did:webvh` Implementations website] and repository is used for interoperability and conformance testing to ensure that each implementation is compliant with the specification and can interoperate with other implementations. The goal is to ensure that the `did:webvh` method is implemented consistently across a wide range of programming languages and platforms. As implementations mature, they can be added to the repository and website.

## Full Implementations

The following are complete implementations of `did:webvh` that support the full set of features and capabilities defined in the current specification. They have been tested for interoperability, and the developers have been comparing notes and providing feedback to one another and to the Working Group to clarify the specification and help future implementors.

- [DIF] -- [Typescript](https://github.com/decentralized-identity/didwebvh-ts)
- [DIF] -- [Python](https://github.com/decentralized-identity/didwebvh-py)
- [Affinidi] -- [Rust](https://github.com/affinidi/affinidi-tdk-rs/tree/main/crates/affinidi-did-resolver/affinidi-did-resolver-methods/did-webvh), [Crate](https://crates.io/crates/did-webvh)

## Partial/PoC Implementations

These implementations are known, but are either incomplete or not fully compliant with the latest specification. They may be useful for building out new implementations.

- [Nuts Foundation] -- [Go](https://github.com/nuts-foundation/trustdidweb-go) (Registrar/Resolver)
- [DIF] -- [Rust](https://github.com/decentralized-identity/didwebvh-rs)  (Registrar/Resolver)

## Other Implementations

These are implementations we know about, but not much. We'll try to learn more and categorize them better in the future.

- [Procivis] -- [Rust](https://github.com/procivis/one-core/tree/main/lib/one-core/src/provider/did_method/webvh) (Resolver)

## Deployment Tools

These are tools that can be used to deploy and manage `did:webvh` implementations, such as servers, watchers and resolvers.

- [DIF] -- [`did:webvh` Server - Python](https://github.com/decentralized-identity/didwebvh-server-py) (Server)
- [DIF] -- [`did:webvh` Watcher - Python](https://github.com/decentralized-identity/didwebvh-watcher-py) (Watcher)
- [DIF] -- [`did:webvh` Universal Resolver Driver] -- based on the [Typescript] implementation.

## DID Controller Capabilities

The following are digital trust agent frameworks that support the `did:webvh` method, allowing users to create, issue, hold, request, present and verify verifiable credentials rooted with `did;webvh` DIDs. [ACA-Py] is primarily a server-side framework, while [Credo-TS] is both a server-side and mobile wallet framework.
