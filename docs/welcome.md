Trust DID Web (`did:tdw`) is an enhancement to the `did:web` DID method,
providing complementary features that address `did:web`'s
limitations. `did:tdw` features include:

- Ongoing publishing of all DID Document (DIDDoc) versions for a DID instead of,
  or alongside a current `did:web` DID/DIDDoc.
- The same DID-to-HTTPS transformation as `did:web`.
- Supports the same [High Assurance DIDs with DNS] mechanism.
- The ability to resolve the full history of the DID using a verifiable chain of
  updates to the DIDDoc from genesis to deactivation.
- A self-certifying identifier (SCID) for the DID. The SCID, globally unique and
  embedded in the DID, is derived from the initial DID log entry. It ensures the integrity
  of the DID's history mitigating the risk of attackers creating a new object with
  the same identifier.
- An optional mechanism for enabling DID portability via the SCID, allowing
  the DID's web location to be moved and the DID string to be updated, both while retaining
  a connection to the predecessor DID(s) and preserving the DID's verifiable history.
- DIDDoc updates contain a proof signed by the DID Controllers *authorized* to
  update the DID.
- An optional mechanism for publishing "pre-rotation" keys to prevent the loss of
  control of a DID in cases where an active private key is compromised.
- An optional mechanism for having collaborating witnesses
  that approve of updates to the DID by a DID Controller before publication.
- DID URL path handling that defaults (but can be overridden) to automatically
  resolving `<did>/path/to/file` by using a comparable DID-to-HTTPS translation
  as for the DIDDoc.
- A DID URL path `<did>/whois` that defaults to automatically returning (if
  published by the DID controller) a Verifiable Presentation containing
  Verifiable Credentials with the DID as the `credentialSubject`,
  signed by the DID.

Combined, the additional features enable greater trust and security without
compromising the simplicity of `did:web`.

The incorporation of the DID Core compatible "/whois" path, drawing inspiration
from the traditional WHOIS protocol [rfc3912](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc3912), offers an easy-to-use,
decentralized, trust registry. The `did:tdw` method aims to establish a more
trusted and secure web environment by providing robust verification processes
and enabling transparency and authenticity in the management of decentralized
digital identities.
